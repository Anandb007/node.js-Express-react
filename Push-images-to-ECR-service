1. Authenticate Docker to AWS ECR

]aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 486408064722.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Description:
    Retrieves a login password for the ECR registry in the us-east-1 region.
    Pipes the password to the Docker login command.
    Authenticates Docker client to the AWS ECR registry located at:
      
    486408064722.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
    Uses the username AWS (default for ECR login).
Purpose:
    Allows Docker to interact with your AWS ECR repositories for pushing and pulling images.

2. Tag Local Docker Images for ECR
docker tag shop-backend:latest 486408064722.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/shop-backend:latest
docker tag shop-frontend:latest 486408064722.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/shop-frontend:latest

Description:
    Tags the local Docker image shop-backend:latest with the full ECR repository URI.
    Tags the local Docker image shop-frontend:latest similarly.
    Format of tag:
        <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repository>:<tag>

Purpose:
    Prepares the images to be pushed to the correct ECR repositories by associating them with the appropriate ECR repository URI.

3. Push Docker Images to AWS ECR
docker push 486408064722.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/frontend-backend-application:shop-backend
docker push 486408064722.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/frontend-backend-application:shop-frontend

Description:
Pushes the tagged images to the specified repositories in AWS ECR.
Note: There appears to be a mismatch between the repository names used in the tag and push commands.
    Images were tagged for shop-backend and shop-frontend repositories.
    Images are pushed to frontend-backend-application repository with tags shop-backend and shop-frontend.

Purpose:
    Uploads the Docker images to ECR, making them available for deployment or further use in AWS services like EKS.
